- Thread handling
  In the case that a DSI wants to process multiple non-blocking operations
  simultaneously, it might be more efficient to use the curl multi
  handle/select loop to handle them all without requiring a thread per
  operation.

- Context Sharing 
  libcurl has data sharing between CURL handles (cookies, DNS, SSL sessions).
  It looks reasonably easy to implement, and may provide performance
  improvements.

- Test cases
  Some of the tests with the embedded XIO HTTP server occasionally fail. 
  I suspect some problem with the xio side, but am not certain.
