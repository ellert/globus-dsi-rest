- Partial transfers with gridftp_op functions
  Currently the GridFTP op specializations will process the entire control
  data steam. If we want to support things S3 multpart uploads or Google Drive
  resumable uploads, we'll need to read only part of the data channel per REST
  request.  This will be made much easier if we have the ordered data channel
  support in the GridFTP server. This is not needed for Google Drive API alpha1

- Thread handling
  In the case that a DSI wants to process multiple non-blocking operations
  simultaneously, it might be more efficient to use the curl multi
  handle/select loop to handle them all without requiring a thread per
  operation.

- Context Sharing 
  libcurl has data sharing between CURL handles (cookies, DNS, SSL sessions).
  It looks reasonably easy to implement, and may provide performance
  improvements.

- Test cases
  Some of the tests with the embedded XIO HTTP server occasionally fail. 
  I suspect some problem with the xio side, but am not certain.
